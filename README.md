## 🔎 Project Overview

This repository implements a complete, reproducible deep-learning pipeline for
**automatic detection of cardiac arrhythmias from single heartbeats**. It takes
a raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, cleans it with digital signal processing,
segments it into individual beats, and classifies each beat with a 1-D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The project is designed to read like an open-source research tool while
remaining approachable: every module is typed, documented, and unit-tested, and
the biomedical reasoning behind each processing step is explained inline.

**What it does, end to end:**

```
Raw ECG ──▶ Band-pass filter ──▶ Beat segmentation ──▶ Normalisation
        ──▶ 1-D CNN ──▶ Arrhythmia class + confidence ──▶ Grad-CAM explanation
```

## ❓ Problem Statement

Cardiovascular disease is the **leading cause of death worldwide**. Arrhythmias
— abnormal heart rhythms — are a major contributor and are diagnosed by
examining the ECG. A single 24-hour Holter recording can contain **over
100,000 heartbeats**, making manual review by a cardiologist slow, expensive,
and prone to fatigue.

> **Goal:** build a model that automatically classifies each heartbeat into a
> clinically meaningful arrhythmia category, so that clinicians can focus their
> attention on the beats most likely to be abnormal.

We frame this as a **5-class supervised classification** problem over the AAMI
EC57 super-classes (see [Dataset](#-dataset)). The central technical challenge
is **severe class imbalance** — roughly 90% of beats are normal — which we
address with class-weighted loss and appropriate, imbalance-aware metrics
(macro-F1, per-class recall) rather than raw accuracy.

## 🩺 Medical Background

An **electrocardiogram (ECG)** measures the electrical activity of the heart via
electrodes on the skin. Each heartbeat produces a characteristic waveform:

| Wave | Physiological meaning |
|------|-----------------------|
| **P wave** | Atrial depolarisation (atria contract) |
| **QRS complex** | Ventricular depolarisation (ventricles contract) — the tall, sharp **R-peak** is the easiest landmark to detect |
| **T wave** | Ventricular repolarisation (ventricles reset) |

An **arrhythmia** is any deviation from the normal rhythm or waveform
morphology. The clinically standard **AAMI EC57** guideline groups the many
annotation symbols into five actionable super-classes:

| AAMI class | Name | Example beats | Clinical note |
|:---------:|------|---------------|---------------|
| **N** | Normal | Normal, bundle-branch block, escape | The healthy baseline |
| **S** | Supraventricular ectopic | Atrial/nodal premature beats | Originate above the ventricles |
| **V** | Ventricular ectopic | PVCs, ventricular escape | Wide, bizarre QRS; can be dangerous |
| **F** | Fusion | Fusion of normal + ventricular | Two impulses collide |
| **Q** | Unknown / paced | Paced, unclassifiable | Pacemaker or artefact |

Detecting **V** and **S** beats is especially important because frequent
ventricular ectopy can precede life-threatening ventricular tachycardia.

> ⚠️ **This is an educational research project, not a medical device.** It must
> never be used for real diagnosis or treatment.

## 📚 Dataset

We use the **[MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/)**,
the most widely cited benchmark in arrhythmia research.

- **48 half-hour recordings** from 47 subjects (records `100`–`234`).
- **2 leads**, sampled at **360 Hz** with 11-bit resolution.
- **~110,000 beats**, each annotated at the R-peak by two independent
  cardiologists.
- The four **paced records** (`102`, `104`, `107`, `217`) are excluded by
  convention, leaving the standard **44-record** evaluation set.

**Automatic download** — the database is fetched on demand with the WFDB
library, so you never have to hunt for files manually:

```bash
python download_data.py            # downloads the full database to data/mitdb/
```

**Preprocessing pipeline** (`src/preprocessing.py`):

1. **Load** signal + expert annotations via `wfdb`.
2. **Band-pass filter** (0.5–40 Hz, zero-phase Butterworth) to remove baseline
   wander and high-frequency muscle noise while preserving the QRS complex.
3. **Segment** each beat as a 360-sample (1-second) window centred on the
   annotated R-peak.
4. **Normalise** each beat (z-score) so the network learns *morphology*, not
   absolute voltage.
5. **Map** raw annotation symbols → AAMI super-classes.

**Patient-wise splitting** — by default the train/validation/test split is done
**by record**, so no heartbeat from a test patient is ever seen during training.
This gives an honest estimate of generalisation to *new patients* (a
beat-wise split inflates scores through patient leakage).

## 🧠 Model Architecture

A configurable 1-D CNN (`src/model.py`). Convolutions are ideal for ECG because
arrhythmias are defined by **local morphological features** (QRS width, P-wave
presence) that are translation-invariant along the time axis.

```
Input  (1 × 360)
  │
  ├─ ConvBlock 1:  Conv1d(1→32,  k=7) → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool(2) → Dropout
  ├─ ConvBlock 2:  Conv1d(32→64, k=7) → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool(2) → Dropout
  ├─ ConvBlock 3:  Conv1d(64→128,k=7) → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool(2) → Dropout
  │
  ├─ Global Average Pooling   (128 × 1)
  ├─ Flatten
  ├─ Linear(128 → 128) → ReLU → Dropout
  └─ Linear(128 → 5)          → (softmax at inference)
```

**Design choices explained:**

- **BatchNorm** stabilises training and adds mild regularisation.
- **MaxPool** gives translation tolerance and grows the receptive field.
- **Dropout** (0.3) combats over-fitting on the imbalanced data.
- **Global average pooling** makes the classifier independent of the input
  length (so `beat_window` is freely configurable) and runs on CPU, CUDA and
  Apple-Silicon MPS alike.
- **No softmax in `forward`** — `CrossEntropyLoss` expects raw logits;
  probabilities are produced only at inference (`predict_proba`).

Everything (channel widths, kernel size, dropout, FC width) is set in
[`config.yaml`](config.yaml).

python -m src.train --epochs 40 --batch-size 256 --lr 5e-4

# 3. Evaluate the best checkpoint on the held-out test set
python -m src.evaluate --checkpoint models/best_model.pt
#    → writes classification report, confusion matrix & ROC curves to outputs/

# 4. Predict every beat in a single record
python -m src.predict --record 100 --checkpoint models/best_model.pt

## 🔬 Explainability (Grad-CAM)

Trusting a medical model means understanding *why* it decided what it did.
`src/gradcam.py` implements **Grad-CAM** for the 1-D CNN, producing a per-sample
saliency curve overlaid on the beat. For a well-behaved model, the **QRS
complex lights up** — confirming the network attends to the physiologically
relevant region rather than noise.

```python
from src.gradcam import GradCAM1D, plot_gradcam
cam = GradCAM1D(model)
saliency = cam(beat_tensor)                    # (L,) importance in [0, 1]
plot_gradcam(beat, saliency, "V", save_path="outputs/figures/gradcam.png")
```

---

## 🖥 Interactive Dashboard

A **Streamlit** app (`app/streamlit_app.py`) lets you explore the model without
writing code: pick a record or upload a beat, see the predicted class,
confidence, probability distribution, and the Grad-CAM explanation.

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

---

## ✅ Testing

The project ships with a `pytest` suite covering the signal-processing math, the
model's forward/backward passes, dataset splitting (no patient leakage!), class
weighting, and Grad-CAM.

```bash
pytest -q                 # run all tests
pytest tests/test_preprocessing.py -v
```

Continuous integration runs the suite on every push via
[GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

---

## 🔭 Future Improvements

- **Sequence models** — add an LSTM/GRU or Transformer head to exploit inter-beat
  rhythm context (RR-interval dynamics), not just single-beat morphology.
- **Both leads** — fuse the two ECG channels instead of using only one.
- **Patient-adaptive** fine-tuning (the AAMI recommended paradigm).
- **Focal loss** as an alternative imbalance strategy.
- **Wearable deployment** — quantise/prune to run on-device (ONNX / TFLite).
- **Larger benchmarks** — validate on the INCART and PTB-XL databases.
